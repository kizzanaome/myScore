# myScore
- This is a command line application that is used to give rating on the EPIC values alignment of Bootcamp candidates during Bootcamp

## Requirements
- `Python3.4` - programming language that can be used on any modern computer operating system. 

## Functionality
- Users come in 3 roles. Bootcampers, LFAs and LFs. 
- Bootcampers are scored daily on all our EPIC values based on their outputs and observed interactions with their teams. The scores --ranges between -2 to 2 i.e (Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Very Satisfied)
- LFs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates in Bootcamp. They however can’t change any of the scores and neither can they add scores.
- LFAs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates that are assigned to them during Bootcamp, add scores for them and edit only their candidate’s scores.
- Bootcampers can only see the scores they have been given. 
- LFs should be able to see which candidates are performing well and those who can’t. They should also be able to see which candidates haven’t been scored yet for a given day.
- Users can be logged in and out.
